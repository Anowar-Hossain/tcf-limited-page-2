                  <h5>Where should I register my company?</h5>
                  <p>
                    If you are a US resident, your best bet is to register in
                    the state where you live and work, rather than Wyoming or
                    Delaware, where you do not operate in. If, on the other
                    hand, you want to prepare your startup for Angel and VC
                    investments, we recommend that you incorporate your company
                    as a corporation in Delaware and foreign qualify the
                    business in the state where you conduct business. Normally,
                    this refers to the state where the founders are located and
                    is often the home of one of the founders.

                    If you are a Non-US resident and do not have any US
                    residents on your team, your best option is to either
                    incorporate in Delaware or Wyoming. If you plan to raise
                    funds from angel investors or venture capitalists, you will
                    need to incorporate a Corporation in Delaware instead of
                    Wyoming.
